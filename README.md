Working standards around OOH creative formats

(Very DRAFT)

## What are the key aspects of a creative?

Goals:
* Reduce the difficulty of larger buys in OOH (esp. multi-publisher)

Candidates:

Resolution (Device Independent Pixels?)

Duration (esp. for Video)

Event Handling (e.g. quartiles)

File sizes (min/max?)

File formats (e.g. mimetype - HTML? Images? Video containers?)

Video Codecs/Compression (are images universal enough not to worry about?)
